Project: Simple Banking System

This project is a command-line-based banking system developed in C, which allows users to manage bank accounts and perform basic banking operations. The system simulates a simple bank, where users can create new accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and transfer funds between accounts. It is designed to store account information using a linked list, making it efficient for managing dynamic data such as account holders and balances.

Key Features:
Account Creation: Users can add new accounts with the account holder's name, account number, and initial balance.

Account Operations:

Withdraw: Users can withdraw a specific amount from their account if they have sufficient balance.
Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account.
Balance Check: Users can check the current balance of any account by providing the account number.
Money Transfer: The system allows transferring money between two accounts, ensuring that the source account has enough balance.
Search and Update:

Users can search for an account by its account number and view the account details.
The system also allows updating the account holder's name for any given account number.
Data Persistence:

The system uses file operations to store and retrieve account information from a file (bank_accounts.txt), ensuring data persists between program runs.
Each operation, like creating a new account or modifying an existing one, is automatically saved to the file.
Linked List Implementation:

I used a linked list to store the bank accounts. Each node contains the account details (name, number, balance) and a pointer to the next account. This makes the system scalable and easy to manage as the number of accounts increases.
Challenges and Learnings:
File Handling: One of the main challenges was ensuring data consistency and correct file handling. I implemented functions to load account data at the start of the program and save updates whenever changes occur, making sure that the data is always up-to-date.
Linked List Management: Using a linked list to dynamically store account data helped me improve my understanding of pointers and memory management in C.
User Interface: Designing a simple and intuitive command-line interface allowed me to focus on the core logic of account management while providing a user-friendly experience.
Conclusion:
This project helped me develop a better understanding of file handling, memory management, and linked list data structures. It also allowed me to practice C programming and implement real-world banking system functionality, such as account creation, balance management, and transfers, in a straightforward and efficient manner.
